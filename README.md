# Hi there, I'm Ali :wave:

I'm a self-taught, passionate Software Developer with over 15 years of experience.

I love building things with technologies like Golang, PHP, JavaScript, Vue.js, Docker, and working with RESTful APIs, gRPC, HTTP and caching. I'm also into setting up smooth CI/CD pipelines that make life easier.

Lately, I've been working a lot with Google Cloud's serverless (fully managed) services â€” including Identity Platform, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Cloud Memorystore, Load Balancer, Cloud Tasks, Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Build, and a bunch more.

Always learning, always building.
